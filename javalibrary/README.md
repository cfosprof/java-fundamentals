# JavaLibrary

JavaLibrary is a utility library for common operations in Java, including rolling dice, checking for duplicates in an array, calculating averages, finding the lowest average sub-array, analyzing weather data, and tallying votes.

## Methods

- `roll(int n)`: Rolls a six-sided die `n` times and returns an ArrayList of the roll results.
- `containsDuplicates(int[] arr)`: Checks if the input array contains duplicate elements and returns true if duplicates are found, otherwise false.
- `calculateAverage(int[] arr)`: Calculates and returns the average of the elements in the input array.
- `getLowestAverageArray(int[][] arr)`: Finds and returns the sub-array with the lowest average from a two-dimensional array.
- `analyzeWeatherData(int[][] weatherData)`: Analyzes the given weather data and returns a summary string containing information about the highest and lowest temperatures and any missing temperatures.
- `tally(List<String> votes)`: Tallies the votes in the input list and returns the candidate with the most votes.
